## Profile

I am a software engineer based in London. I am comfortable working in both Unix and Windows environments. I’ve been coding commercially since 2011, and as a hobby for the decade prior. My passion is high volume transactional systems, data analytics, and automation. My experience is mostly financial, working on accounting, expense tracking, trading platforms & banking systems.<br>

My job is to deliver working, well tested, and maintainable solutions that follow industry best practices and standards. Where possible, I prefer to share & open source my projects. In my personal time I am active in my local developer communities, and when time allows I compete in hackathons & start-up weekends. I follow a number of blogs and websites to keep up with new trends and technologies.<br>
